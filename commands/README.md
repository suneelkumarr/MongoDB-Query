## Creation

To show dbs:

```
show dbs 
```

To create a db named as `user`:

```
use user
```

To add collections and users to it:

```
db.user.insertOne({ name: "karan" })
```

## Deletion

To delete a database:

```
use user
db.dropDatabase()
```

To delete a collection:

```
db.users.drop()
```

## Import

```
mongoimport tv-shows.json -d movieData -c movies --jsonArray --drop
```

Where `movieData` is the database name, `movies` is the collection name and `--drop` tells to override the existing db/collection.
